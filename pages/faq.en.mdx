# FAQ

## How to buy and stake?

Watch this guide.

## Big protec vs Smol protec. Which one should I go for?

If you've got the cash go for Big protec. You'll need to deposit an equal amount of both $EGGS and $ETH, whereas Smol protec only requires $EGGS.

## Will putting in more money increase the length of my lock period?

No. Depositing more won't change the lock time, it'll just reset the timer.

## Do the rewards in the vaults get debased too?

They will only get debased after claim.

## Will making a claim extend my lock period?

No. Each claim won't change your lock period, it'll just reset the timer for another 24 hours.

## Can the reward rate change in the future?

Yes. The dev might adjust the rewards, so stay tuned for any announcements.

## Will the value of EGGS go up or down due to the debase?

If noone is selling then the value of EGGS will remain flat even if there is debase and supply decreases.
How come this is true? Remember EGGS in LP also gets debased which means that there will be less EGGS but same amount of ETH.
The debase of your EGGS is directly proportional to the total supply debase.
For example, if the total supply is 1000 EGGS and you have 100 EGGS, if the total supply becomes 100 EGGS, your 100 EGGS will become 10 EGGS.

**Egg scenario assuming no rewards:**

- Total supply: 100 EGGS
- 20 EGGS in LP paired with 20 ETH
- 1 EGGS = 1 ETH
- The rest staked in smol protec vault (80 EGGS)

**Assuming noone buys or sells and supply debases by 50% this happens:**

- Total supply: 50 EGGS
- 10 EGGS in LP paired with 20 ETH
- 1 EGGS = 2 ETH (now worth more in ETH)
- The rest staked in smol protec vault (40 EGGS)

## Should I stake or skip it?

Stake away! If you do, you'll earn $EGGS that will only be debased after you claim.
The debased $EGGS will still keep their value, since the total supply will also be debased 1:1.
