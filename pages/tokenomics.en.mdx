# Tokenomics

- Initial Supply: 3,324,324,324,357
- Burned: ~931,616,056,878
- Current supply: less than ~2,000,000,000,000 (decreasing every block)
- Dev has burned all his LP tokens and most of the current liquidity is now community owned.

EGGS started as a LBP on Copper/Fjord to get a fair price and distribution of tokens.
Link to LBP [here](https://fjordfoundry.com/pools/mainnet/0x04EEECa0d37a238B46DeD385F04F956F6D9656A2).
LBP managed to accrue around 188.78 ETH.
Dev exited LBP and used 185 ETH and 175,000,000,000 EGGS to create an Uniswap V2 pool. Setting the price just below final LBP price.
Some time after dev burned all his LP tokens. Most of the liquidity you see now is community owned.

### Mechanics

EGGS are getting debased every block with a 0.001% rate which is around 7% a day.
To compensate a little for this decrease you can stake your tokens in either Big or Smol vaults and get rewards.
Rewards will only get debased upon claim! Rewards are currently set to 10,000,000 EGGS per block.
Rewards can be changed by dev and is subject to change.

Depositing or claiming will incur 24 hours lock on withdrawals.
Depositing or claiming will not extend the timer but the timer will reset with another 24 hours.
The debase is happening for the whole token supply including EGGS in vaults and EGGS in LP.
Since EGGS in LP also gets debased the amount of EGGS will decrease but the amount of ETH will remain the same.
That's the beauty of it since the price of EGGS will continue to increase if noone is selling and ETH is stable.

## Contracts

EGGS token has a mint function but the owner is a Timelock contract which has been set to 3 days.
So everyone has time to react for 3 days if dev does something.
