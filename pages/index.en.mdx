# What is Eggs? ðŸ¥š

EGGS is an eggsperiment in decentralized finance.
The evil Egg Cartel are running rampage around the world stealing precious EGGS. Hence, the EGGS supply is getting debased every block.

Currently EGGS exist on two networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet [$EGGS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eggs)
- Arbitrum [$aEGGS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aeggs)

#### What consequences does the debase have?

The rebase era is over, and EGGS will spike a new revolution with debase tokens.
The debase will increase the value of your EGGS automatically if noone is selling.
How is that possible? Debase affects the EGGS that are in LP, therefore the number of EGGS in LP will decrease over time while the amount of ETH remains constant.

If you understand this concept you have been egg-pilled.

## How do we protec our EGGS?

You can protect your EGGS by locking them in secure vaults.
Once they have been locked, they will not need to be re-locked at the end of the minimum locking period.

| Vault Name | Minimum Locking Period | % Of Rewards | Eggs will debase |
| :--------: | :--------------------: | :----------: | :--------------: |
| Full       |         7 days         |  None        | False            |
| Big        |         1 day          |  90%         | True             |
| Smol       |         1 day          |  10%         | True             |

Claiming rewards from Big or Smol will reset the timer and lock for another 24 hours.
Depositing or claiming will NOT extend your locking period further.
Partial withdrawals will NOT lock for these two types of vaults.
