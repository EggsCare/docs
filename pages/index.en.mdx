# What is Eggs? ðŸ¥š

EGGS is an eggsperiment in decentralized finance.
The evil Egg Cartel are going rampage around the world stealing precious EGGS.
This has grave consequences and the EGGS supply is getting debased (decreasing) by 0.001% every block which is around 7% per day.

#### What consequences does this have?

The rebase era is over but EGGS will spike a new revolution with debase tokens.
The debase will increase the value of your EGGS automatically if noone are selling.
How is that possible? Remember that debase also affects LP. So less EGGS in LP over time but same amount of ETH.

If you understand this concept you have been egg-pilled.

## How do we protec our EGGS?

You can protect your EGGS by depositing into secure vaults. There are three types of vaults.
Full, big and smol protect vaults.
Full protec vault will protect your precious eggs FULLY and won't be affected by debase.
Full protec vault has a locking period of 7 days on deposit and partial withdrawals.
No relocks required.

The other two vaults only protect your EGGS partially in the form of rewards.
The rewards are 10 million EGGS per block. Big protec vault earns you 9/10 of the rewards by staking EGGS/ETH LP on Uniswap V2.
The smol protec vault earns you only 1/10 of the rewards. Both of these vaults only have a locking period of 24 hours.

Depositing your EGGS in either vaults will lock them for 24 hours.
Claiming rewards will reset timer and lock for another 24 hours.
Depositing or claiming will NOT extend your locking period further.
Partial withdrawals will NOT lock for these two types of vaults.
